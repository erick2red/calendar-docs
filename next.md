The Fast TODO list
===================

+ [x] Add locked icon to event widgets depending on the write-ability of the calendar
+ [x] Add contrasting event name to event widget depending on background color
+ [ ] Rewrite edit-dialog according new (*upcoming*) mockups. This will take into account:
 	* basic info: title, start/end, location (*maps*), notes, calendar selection
	* attendance, guests
	* reminders
	* attachments
	* recurrence
	* change of DONE button of the dialog for Save when the event is editable
+ [ ] Rethink all-day event area on week-view day-view according to new mockups
+ [x] Rewrite month-view painting/allocating to handle overflow of events
+ [x] Make search-view not a fixed view
+ [ ] Show the search-view once the search has started
+ [ ] Add search-mode to event-widget (to show date and buttons?)
+ [ ] Use event widget on the search-view or something like it.
      Better use event widget to use sync css styling between views and search-views
