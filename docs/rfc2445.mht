     Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
                              (iCalendar)

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the &quot;Internet
   Official Protocol Standards&quot; (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This memo
   has been defined to provide the definition of a common format for
   openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
   Internet.

   This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type per
   [RFC 2048]. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable
   for use outside of a MIME message content type.

   The proposed media type value is &#x27;text/calendar&#x27;. This string =
would
   label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
   encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.

   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event, to-do and journal entry information. It also can be
   used to convey free/busy time information. The content type is
   suitable as a MIME message entity that can be transferred over MIME
   based email systems, using HTTP or some other Internet transport. In

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   addition, the content type is useful as an object for interactions
   between desktop applications using the operating system clipboard,
   drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

   This memo is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar specification
   for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling information.
   In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work, this memo is
   to be known as the iCalendar specification.

   This memo defines the format for specifying iCalendar object methods.
   An iCalendar object method is a set of usage constraints for the
   iCalendar object. For example, these methods might define scheduling
   messages that request an event be scheduled, reply to an event
   request, send a cancellation notice for an event, modify or replace
   the definition of an event, provide a counter proposal for an
   original event request, delegate an event request to another
   individual, request free or busy time, reply to a free or busy time
   request, or provide similar scheduling messages for a to-do or
   journal entry calendar component. The iCalendar Transport-indendent
   Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined in [ITIP] is one such
   scheduling protocol.

1 Introduction

   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology. However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these knowledgeware applications. This memo is intended to progress
   the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring
   and scheduling applications. This memo defines a MIME content type
   for exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The
   Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
   iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information
   normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such
   as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling
   product.

   The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between
   applications or systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME
   content type. This will enable the object to be exchanged using
   several transports, including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file
   system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-
   based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point
   asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of

=0C
RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.

   The memo also provides for the definition of iCalendar object methods
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments, to-dos and
   journal entries. The iCalendar object methods can be used to define
   other calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data. Such a scheduling protocol is
   defined in the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) defined in [ITIP].

   The memo also includes a formal grammar for the content type based on
   the Internet ABNF defined in [RFC 2234]. This ABNF is required for
   the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive
   reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the
   descriptive prose definition of the memo.

2 Basic Grammar and Conventions

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quo=
t;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &qu=
ot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot; and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interoperated as describ=
ed in
   [RFC 2119].

   This memo makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC 2234].
   Readers intending on implementing this format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications of this memo.

   All numeric and hexadecimal values used in this memo are given in
   decimal notation.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive. However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

        Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are
        intended to provide the reader with additional information. The
        information is not essential to the building of an
        implementation conformant with this memo. The information is
        provided to highlight a particular feature or characteristic of
        the memo.

   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   [RFC 2425] content type. While the iCalendar object is not a profile
   of the [RFC 2425] content type, it does reuse a number of the
   elements from the [RFC 2425] specification.

2.1 Formatting Conventions

   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose. Many of the
   terms used to describe these have common usage that is different than
   the standards usage of this memo. In order to reference within this
   memo elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
   (this memo) or interoperability protocol [ITIP] some formatting
   conventions have been used. Calendaring and scheduling roles are
   referred to in quoted-strings of text with the first character of
   each word in upper case. For example, &quot;Organizer&quot; refers to a =
role of
   a &quot;Calendar User&quot; within the scheduling protocol defined by [I=
TIP].
   Calendar components defined by this memo are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start
   with the letter &quot;V&quot;. For example, &quot;VEVENT&quot; refers to=
 the event
   calendar component, &quot;VTODO&quot; refers to the to-do calendar compo=
nent
   and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; refers to the daily journal calendar component.
   Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example, &quot;REQUEST&quot; re=
fers to
   the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created
   or modified, &quot;REPLY&quot; refers to the method a recipient of a req=
uest
   uses to update their status with the &quot;Organizer&quot; of the calend=
ar
   component.

   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word &quot;property&quot;. For e=
xample,
   &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; property refers to the iCalendar property used to c=
onvey
   the calendar address of a calendar user. Property parameters defined
   by this memo are referred to with lowercase, quoted-strings of text,
   followed by the word &quot;parameter&quot;. For example, &quot;value&quo=
t; parameter
   refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override the
   default data type for a property value. Enumerated values defined by
   this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either alone or
   followed by the word &quot;value&quot;. For example, the &quot;MINUTELY&=
quot; value can
   be used with the &quot;FREQ&quot; component of the &quot;RECUR&quot; dat=
a type to specify
   repeating components based on an interval of one minute or more.

2.2 Related Memos

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards. This memo, [ICAL], specifies a core
   specification of objects, data types, properties and property
   parameters.

   [ITIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
   between different implementations;

   [IMIP] specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

2.3 International Considerations

   In the rest of this document, descriptions of characters are of the
   form &quot;character name (codepoint)&quot;, where &quot;codepoint&quot;=
 is from the US-
   ASCII character set. The &quot;character name&quot; is the authoritative
   description; (codepoint) is a reference to that character in US-ASCII
   or US-ASCII compatible sets (for example the ISO-8859-x family, UTF-
   8, ISO-2022-xx, KOI8-R). If a non-US-ASCII compatible character set
   is used, appropriate code-point from that character set MUST be
   chosen instead. Use of non-US-ASCII-compatible character sets is NOT
   recommended.

3  Registration Information

   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification is intended
   for use as a MIME content type. However, the implementation of the
   memo is in no way limited solely as a MIME content type.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


3.2 Parameters

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, method, component and optinfo

   The &quot;charset&quot; parameter is defined in [RFC 2046] for other body
   parts. It is used to identify the default character set used within
   the body part.

   The &quot;method&quot; parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object =
method
   or transaction semantics for the calendaring and scheduling
   information. It also is an identifier for the restricted set of
   properties and values that the iCalendar object consists of. The
   parameter is to be used as a guide for applications interpreting the
   information contained within the body part. It SHOULD NOT be used to
   exclude or require particular pieces of information unless the
   identified method definition specifically calls for this behavior.
   Unless specifically forbidden by a particular method definition, a
   text/calendar content type can contain any set of properties
   permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification. The &quot;method&quot; parameter MUST be the same value a=
s that
   specified in the &quot;METHOD&quot; component property in the iCalendar =
object.
   If one is present, the other MUST also be present.

   The value for the &quot;method&quot; parameter is defined as follows:

        method  =3D 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;-&quot;)
        ; IANA registered iCalendar object method

   The &quot;component&quot; parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calend=
ar
   component within the body part. If the iCalendar object contains more
   than one calendar component type, then multiple component parameters
   MUST be specified.

   The value for the &quot;component&quot; parameter is defined as follows:

        component       =3D (&quot;VEVENT&quot; / &quot;VTODO&quot; / &quot=
;VJOURNAL&quot; / &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot;
                        / &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; / x-name / iana-token)

   The &quot;optinfo&quot; parameter conveys optional information about the
   iCalendar object within the body part. This parameter can only
   specify semantics already specified by the iCalendar object and that
   can be otherwise determined by parsing the body part. In addition,
   the optional information specified by this parameter MUST be
   consistent with that information specified by the iCalendar object.
   For example, it can be used to convey the &quot;Attendee&quot; response =
status
   to a meeting request. The parameter value consists of a string value.

=0C
RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The parameter can be specified multiple times.

   This parameter MAY only specify semantics already specified by the
   iCalendar object and that can be otherwise determined by parsing the
   body part.

   The value for the &quot;optinfo&quot; parameter is defined as follows:

        optinfo =3D infovalue / qinfovalue

        infovalue       =3D iana-token / x-name

        qinfovalue      =3D DQUOTE (infovalue) DQUOTE

3.3 Content Header Fields

   Optional content header fields: Any header fields defined by [RFC
   2045].

3.4 Encoding Considerations

   This MIME content type can contain 8bit characters, so the use of
   quoted-printable or BASE64 MIME content-transfer-encodings might be
   necessary when iCalendar objects are transferred across protocols
   restricted to the 7bit repertoire. Note that a text valued property
   in the content entity can also have content encoding of special
   characters using a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92)
   escapement technique. This means that content values can end up
   encoded twice.

3.5 Security Considerations

   SPOOFING - - In this memo, the &quot;Organizer&quot; is the only person
   authorized to make changes to an existing &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTOD=
O&quot;,
   &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component and redistribute the updates to =
the
   &quot;Attendees&quot;. An iCalendar object that maliciously changes or c=
ancels
   an existing &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot=
; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar
   component might be constructed by someone other than the &quot;Organizer=
&quot;
   and sent to the &quot;Attendees&quot;. In addition in this memo, other t=
han the
   &quot;Organizer&quot;, an &quot;Attendee&quot; of a &quot;VEVENT&quot;, =
&quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot;
   calendar component is the only other person authorized to update any
   parameter associated with their &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; property and send i=
t to
   the &quot;Organizer&quot;. An iCalendar object that maliciously changes =
the
   &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; parameters can be constructed by someone other than=
 the
   real &quot;Attendee&quot; and sent to the &quot;Organizer&quot;.

   PROCEDURAL ALARMS - - An iCalendar object can be created that
   contains a &quot;VEVENT&quot; and &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component w=
ith &quot;VALARM&quot;
   calendar components. The &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component can be of=
 type
   PROCEDURE and can have an attachment containing some sort of
   executable program. Implementations that incorporate these types of
   alarms are subject to any virus or malicious attack that might occur
   as a result of executing the attachment.

   ATTACHMENTS - - An iCalendar object can include references to Uniform
   Resource Locators that can be programmed resources.

   Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
   security implications of accepting and parsing such information. In
   addition, the security considerations observed by implementations of
   electronic mail systems should be followed for this memo.

3.6 Interoperability Considerations

   This MIME content type is intended to define a common format for
   conveying calendaring and scheduling information between different
   systems. It is heavily based on the earlier [VCAL] industry
   specification.

3.7 Applications Which Use This Media Type

   This content-type is designed for widespread use by Internet
   calendaring and scheduling applications. In addition, applications in
   the workflow and document management area might find this content-
   type applicable. The [ITIP] and [IMIP] Internet protocols directly
   use this content-type also. Future work on an Internet calendar
   access protocol will utilize this content-type too.

3.8 Additional Information

   This memo defines this content-type.

3.9 Magic Numbers

   None.

3.10 File Extensions

   The file extension of &quot;ics&quot; is to be used to designate a file
   containing (an arbitrary set of) calendaring and scheduling
   information consistent with this MIME content type.

4 iCalendar Object Specification

   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification. This information is intended to
   be an integral part of the MIME content type registration. In
   addition, this information can be used independent of such content
   registration. In particular, this memo has direct applicability for
   use as a calendaring and scheduling exchange format in file-, memory-
   or network-based transport mechanisms.

4.1 Content Lines

   The iCalendar object is organized into individual lines of text,
   called content lines. Content lines are delimited by a line break,
   which is a CRLF sequence (US-ASCII decimal 13, followed by US-ASCII
   decimal 10).

   Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
   break. Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
   representations using a line &quot;folding&quot; technique. That is, a l=
ong
   line can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF
   immediately followed by a single linear white space character (i.e.,
   SPACE, US-ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9). Any sequence
   of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear white space character
   is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content type.

   For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
      ng description
       that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple line representation
   to its single line representation is called &quot;unfolding&quot;. Unfol=
ding is
   accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the linear white
   space character that immediately follows.

   When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first be unfolded
   according to the unfolding procedure described above. When generating
   a content line, lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded
   according to the folding procedure described above.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by [RFC 2425]. That
   is, the content information consists of CRLF-separated content lines.

   The following notation defines the lines of content in an iCalendar
   object:

     contentline        =3D name *(&quot;;&quot; param ) &quot;:&quot; valu=
e CRLF
        ; This ABNF is just a general definition for an initial parsing
        ; of the content line into its property name, parameter list,
        ; and value string

     ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first
        ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
        ; described above. When generating a content line, lines
        ; longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded according to
        ; the folding procedure described above.

   The property value component of a content line has a format that is
   property specific. Refer to the section describing each property for
   a definition of this format.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive. However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

4.1.1 List and Field Separators

   Some properties and parameters allow a list of values. Values in a
   list of values MUST be separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44). There is no significance to the order of values in a
   list. For those parameter values (such as those that specify URI
   values) that are specified in quoted-strings, the individual quoted-
   strings are separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

   Some property values are defined in terms of multiple parts. These
   structured property values MUST have their value parts separated by a
   SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Some properties allow a list of parameters. Each property parameter
   in a list of property parameters MUST be separated by a SEMICOLON
   character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Property parameters with values containing a COLON, a SEMICOLON or a
   COMMA character MUST be placed in quoted text.

   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters from each other, and a COMMA is used to
   separate property values in a value list.

     ATTENDEE;RSVP=3DTRUE;ROLE=3DREQ-PARTICIPANT:MAILTO:
      jsmith@host.com

     RDATE;VALUE=3DDATE:19970304,19970504,19970704,19970904

4.1.2 Multiple Values

   Some properties defined in the iCalendar object can have multiple
   values. The general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to simply
   create a new content line for each value, including the property
   name. However, it should be noted that some properties support
   encoding multiple values in a single property by separating the
   values with a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44). Individual
   property definitions should be consulted for determining whether a
   specific property allows multiple values and in which of these two
   forms.

4.1.3 Binary Content

   Binary content information in an iCalendar object SHOULD be
   referenced using a URI within a property value. That is the binary
   content information SHOULD be placed in an external MIME entity that
   can be referenced by a URI from within the iCalendar object. In
   applications where this is not feasible, binary content information



Dawson &amp; Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 16]
=0C
RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   can be included within an iCalendar object, but only after first
   encoding it into text using the &quot;BASE64&quot; encoding method defin=
ed in
   [RFC 2045]. Inline binary contact SHOULD only be used in applications
   whose special circumstances demand that an iCalendar object be
   expressed as a single entity. A property containing inline binary
   content information MUST specify the &quot;ENCODING&quot; property param=
eter.
   Binary content information placed external to the iCalendar object
   MUST be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (URI).

   The following example specifies an &quot;ATTACH&quot; property that refe=
rences
   an attachment external to the iCalendar object with a URI reference:

     ATTACH:http://xyz.com/public/quarterly-report.doc

   The following example specifies an &quot;ATTACH&quot; property with inli=
ne
   binary encoded content information:

     ATTACH;FMTTYPE=3Dimage/basic;ENCODING=3DBASE64;VALUE=3DBINARY:
      MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1U
      EBhMCVVMxLDAqBgNVBAoTI05ldHNjYXBlIENvbW11bmljYXRpb25zIE
        &lt;...remainder of &quot;BASE64&quot; encoded binary data...&gt;

4.1.4 Character Set

   There is not a property parameter to declare the character set used
   in a property value. The default character set for an iCalendar
   object is UTF-8 as defined in [RFC 2279].

   The &quot;charset&quot; Content-Type parameter can be used in MIME trans=
ports
   to specify any other IANA registered character set.

4.2 Property Parameters

   A property can have attributes associated with it. These &quot;property
   parameters&quot; contain meta-information about the property or the
   property value. Property parameters are provided to specify such
   information as the location of an alternate text representation for a
   property value, the language of a text property value, the data type
   of the property value and other attributes.

   Property parameter values that contain the COLON (US-ASCII decimal
   58), SEMICOLON (US-ASCII decimal 59) or COMMA (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   character separators MUST be specified as quoted-string text values.
   Property parameter values MUST NOT contain the DOUBLE-QUOTE (US-ASCII
   decimal 22) character. The DOUBLE-QUOTE (US-ASCII decimal 22)
   character is used as a delimiter for parameter values that contain
   restricted characters or URI text. For example:
